The following command is all that is required to enable building umr on a fresh
CentOS 9 STREAM install (after an initial "yum -y update"):

yum install cmake automake autoconf libdrm-devel llvm-devel llvm-static libpciaccess* ncurses-devel zlib-devel libdrm-devel vim gcc gcc-c++ gdb strace make libSDL2* SDL2-devel* 

(note strace/gdb/vim aren't strictly necessary but I tend to install those reflexively ...)
