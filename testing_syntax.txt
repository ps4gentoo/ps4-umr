; this syntax will be used by mmio/vram/sysram callbacks to pretend
; like we're on a live system to allow umr testing with known answers

SYSRAM@0x123456000={...} ; data is specified as a unformated list of hexadecimal bytes (leading 0)
VRAM@0x123456000={...} ; data specified like SYSRAM
MMIO@0x12345={...[,...]} ; can specify multiple values that will be read in turn with the last value being read on all subsequent reads
; note reads from select special registers like SQ_IND_INDEX/DATA or MM_INDEX/DATA will be
; interpreted as SQ or VRAM accesses and not go through the MMIO lookup
SQ@0x12345={...} ; SQ indirect space where address is the value of mmSQ_IND_INDEX
