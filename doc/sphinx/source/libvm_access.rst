=============
GPU VM Access
=============

Access to the GPUs virtual (and physical) memory is possible through
the following function:

::

	int umr_access_vram(struct umr_asic *asic, int vm_partition, uint32_t vmid, uint64_t address, uint32_t size, void *data, int write_en);

This will access the memory in the VMID indicated by 'vmid' at the
address pointed to by 'address'.

The function will read or write 'size' bytes using the buffer pointed
to by 'data' appropriately.  If the 'write_en' parameter is non-zero
then the function will write to memory, otherwise it reads.

The 'vmid' parameter has various interpretations based on the higher
order bits.  If bits 8..15 are set to **UMR_LINEAR_HUB** then the
address is considered a physical address and the VRAM is read
directly.  

The 'vm_partition' parameter indicates which VM partition to use when
decoding a GPUVM space.  '-1' is the default for all existing ASICs.
Future ASICs may have multiple GC or MMHUB (or other) blocks which
means they will need to be indicated here.  The value is used to modify
the name of the IP block being searched for.

The scheme in umr for multiple blocks is to use {} braces with a number.
For instance, 'clk{0}' refers to the 0'th instance of a CLK IP block, whereas,
'clk{3}' would refer to the fourth instance.  Note that in an ASIC with
a single IP block the {} braces are omitted, e.g., 'clk' not 'clk{0}'.


Example usage:

::

	unsigned char buf[4096];

	umr_access_vram(asic, -1, (UMR_LINEAR_HUB << 8), 0x1234000, 4096, buf, 0);

This example will read a page of VRAM from the address 0x1234000 to
the buffer 'buf'.

The function responds to various options that can be specified
in the ''asic'' device.  With the 'use_pci' option specified it will
use directly MMIO access to read the VRAM.  With the 'verbose' option
specified it will print out debug information and PTE/PDE decodings.

On AI and higher platforms (starting with vega10 for instance) there
is a second memory hub (multimedia hub) which is accessible by
using the **UMR_MM_HUB** flag in the same second 8 bits, for instance:

::

	unsigned char buf[4096];

	umr_access_vram(asic, -1, (UMR_MM_HUB << 8) | 1, 0xFFEE000, 4096, buf, 0);

Will read a page from the address 0xFFEE000 in the VMID \#1 under the MM
hub (for instance, a job from the UVD IP block).

To read from the GFX hub (which is the default) the **UMR_GFX_HUB**
flag can be used.  It is equal to zero so for these requests it
can be safely omitted completely.

---------------------
Read and Write Macros
---------------------

To make access to VM memory simpler there are read and write macros:

::

	#define umr_read_vram(asic, vm_partition, vmid, address, size, dst) umr_access_vram(asic, vm_partition, vmid, address, size, dst, 0)
	#define umr_write_vram(asic, vm_partition, vmid, address, size, src) umr_access_vram(asic, vm_partition, vmid, address, size, src, 1)

Which take the same order of parameters as umr_access_vram() but omit the write_en parameter.

------------
XGMI Support
------------

On linux hosts with the XGMI sysfs support the umr_scan_config() function
can be used to detect XGMI and map nodes:

::

	int umr_scan_config(struct umr_asic *asic, int xgmi_scan);

With 'xgmi_scan' set to 1 the call will populate the xgmi configuration
data (if any).  This will allow a VM access on 'asic' to access the
VRAM backing the VM address on any node in the XGMI array.

Behind the scenes the first time umr_access_vram() is called after this
point the callbacks for register and memory access will be copied down
to all XGMI node 'asic' instances.  So it is required to set the callbacks
BEFORE calling umr_scan_config().

The call to umr_scan_config() also copies the "use_colour" and "verbose"
options from 'asic' to all of the node 'asic' instances which is used
by umr_access_vram() recursively.
